# LLM Module Documentation

This module, `llm`, is designed to provide functionalities related to large language models. 
It serves as a core component of the overall project, enabling advanced text processing and generation capabilities.

## Features

- Integration with various language model APIs.
- Support for text generation, summarization, and other NLP tasks.
- Extensible architecture for adding new features and models.

## Usage

The `Responder` class in this module facilitates interaction with a configured language model. 
It uses the `request` module to handle HTTP requests, abstracting the complexity of network communication. 
The `respond` method sends a prompt to the language model and retrieves the generated response.
